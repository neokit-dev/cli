# `nktool`

The NeoKit CLI

## Installation

You don't really need to install the package as you can run it directly with `npx`. But if you really want to:

```bash
sudo npm i -g nktool
```

## Usage

```bash
npx nktool # or just `nktool` if you installed it globally
```

## Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neokit-dev/cli.git nktool
cd nktool
npm i
npm run build
```
